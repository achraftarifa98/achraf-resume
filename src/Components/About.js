            <div>
              Hello there, happy to see you &#128512;
              <br />
              My name is achraf tarifa a third year computer science student and
              project manager of the IEEE ENIS Student Branch. I am currently
              looking for an internship for my graduation. As I think this is an
              opportunity to improve myself so I am open to any offer that
              challenges or requires me to work outside of my Knowledge set.{" "}
              <br />
              Iâ€™ve always been passionate about technology and as a future
              software engineer, I believe that Technology has the ability to
              impact lives at a level and scale that has never been realized in
              the history of mankind so The idea that something I create can
              impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what
              drives my passion for Technology.
